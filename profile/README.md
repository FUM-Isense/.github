# Cybathlon
The Cybathlon, an international competition organized by ETH Zurich, provides a platform for teams worldwide to create assistive technologies that improve daily life for people with disabilities. One of the competition’s disciplines, the [Vision Assistance Race](https://cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/event/disciplines/vis), focuses specifically on solutions for individuals with visual impairments.

As the [iSense team](https://cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/teams/i-sense), we proudly participated in this challenge. You can explore our implementations and learn more about each task here.

# Tasks

The competition tasks are inspired by everyday challenges encountered by individuals with visual impairments.

1. **Dishup**

	Serving food is a challenge for blind people since plates and glasses must be kept horizontal to make sure that contents are not spilled while walking. 
In this task, pilots must serve food and place it on the table.

	|------------------------|------------------------|


2. **Doorbell**
		
	Finding the right bell on a large doorbell panel is often very demanding for blind people. The confined space, and the variety of name combinations are especially challenging for assistive technologies.
In this task, pilots must find the correct name on the doorbell panel and ring the bell.

	|------------------------|------------------------|

4. **Empty Seats**

	Finding an empty seat (e.g., when travelling in a train or visiting a theater) is a challenge for blind people.
In this task, pilots must identify the empty seats.

	|------------------------|------------------------|

4. **Grocery**

	Shopping for groceries is extremely challenging and time consuming for blind people. They usually ask a care person, other shoppers or shop staff for assistance when searching for specific products.
In this task, pilots must find a specific product in the shelf.

	|------------------------|------------------------|

5. **Sidewalk**

	When walking in a public space, blind people are often confronted with physical obstacles (e.g., an e-scooter that is carelessly left on a sidewalk). This may lead to collisions and falls. 
In this task, pilots must negotiate a set of obstacles obstructing their path.

	|------------------------|------------------------|

6. **Finder**

	Finding misplaced objects is a big challenge for blind people. Therefore, they usually keep their own apartment very tidy. However, this is not always possible, e.g., with kids. 
In this task pilots must locate and grasp a specific object from a group of other objects.

	|------------------------|------------------------|

7.  **Footpath**

	Blind people use a white cane to detect changes in terrain, such as the boundary between a paved path and the lawn on the side. However, the cane can get stuck on protruding roots, stones or potholes which is unpleasant for the user. 
In this task, pilots must follow a path without touching the ground on the side.

	|------------------------|------------------------|

8. **Colours**

	Without assistance, identifying colours is not possible for blind people. However, this is important in many situations in daily life (e.g., when selecting colour matching clothes).
In this task, pilots must identify sets of different colours and sort them according to their gradations.

	| <img src="https://github.com/FUM-Isense/.github/blob/main/profile/media/colors.jpg?raw=true" width="250" alt="Image 1"> | <img src="https://github.com/FUM-Isense/.github/blob/main/profile/media/colors_model.png?raw=true" height="280" alt="Image 2"> |
	|------------------------|------------------------|

9. **Touchscreen**

	Many user interfaces are nowadays based on touch screens (e.g., vending machines, the menu in restaurants). Their use is primarily based on visual perception, and they rarely provide the necessary accessibility for a blind person.
In this task, pilots must navigate a touchscreen and order a predefined item from a variety of foods.

	|------------------------|------------------------|

10. **Forest**

	Objects that are located at different heights (e.g., a tree’s branch that hangs on the walkway, or truckers’ tail lift) are difficult to be detected by blind people but bear a high potential for collisions and injury.
In this task, pilots must navigate through a maze of obstacles which are located at different heights.
